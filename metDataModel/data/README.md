## Data shipped with metDataModel

Work in progress

### metabolic models

in Python objects 
and in JSON

### LC-MS Metabolomics data

Will add examples of XIC, peaks, features and empCpds.

In web services, use JSON whenever possible, and 
HDF5 for large data. 

There are multiple XML formats used in mass spec data (proteomics and metabolomics). Not used for intermediate steps unless justified.

### Test data and other example user data for mummichog

- testdata0710.txt

- User input data as a list of empCpds (JSON).

- Mummichog results: pathway analysis, module/network analysis, updated empCpd probabilities.
