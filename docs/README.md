# Steps in metabolomics data processing and analysis

Here, we try to define the major steps in mass spectrometry based metabolomics data processing and analysis, intended functions and goals.


## LC-MS

Conversion of raw data to open formats

feature extraction

  construction of chromatogram
  
  Peak picking ()

  alignment

Annotation

  grouping ions
  
  computational annotation
  
  identification



## LC-MS/MS

To-do.





## GC-MS

To-do.
